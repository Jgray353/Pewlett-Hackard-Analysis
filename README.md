# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use CSV files to build databases in order to determine employees close to retirement age and employees eligible for a mentorship program to fill the positions that will be left by those retiring. 

1. The analysis shows over 90,000 employees are nearing retirement
2. Senior engineer and senior staff are the departments with the highest numbers of those near retirement, each with over 20,000
3. Engineer and staff are also going to be significantly affected with over 10,000 employees in each department near retirement
4. 1549 employees are compiled in the database results for being eligible for mentorship 

## Summary
Pewlett Hackard is likely to face deficits in several departments, given the high number of those nearing retirement vs. the number of employees eligible for mentorship. The company should expand its mentorship, or work on external recruting to fill senior positions with people who have the experience/tenure needed.
